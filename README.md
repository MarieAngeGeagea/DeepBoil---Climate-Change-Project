# Predicting Bubble Dynamics with Deep Learning

## Motivation: 
Boiling is a complex phase-change phenomenon essential for applications like electronics cooling, nuclear energy, and desalination. However,
modeling boiling bubbles is challenging due to multiphysics interactions, including phase transitions, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.
Traditional CFD simulations are costly and hard to scale. BubbleML, a high-resolution dataset from Flash-X simulations, enables ML models to
efficiently learn and predict bubble dynamics. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we aim to bridge the gap between physical simulations and
forecasting, making bubble behavior prediction more accessible and cost-effective
