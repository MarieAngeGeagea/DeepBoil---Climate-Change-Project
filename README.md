# Predicting Bubble Dynamics with Deep Learning

## Motivation: 
Boiling is a complex phase-change phenomenon essential for applications like electronics cooling, nuclear energy, and desalination. However,
modeling boiling bubbles is challenging due to multiphysics interactions, including phase transitions, fluid dynamics, and heat transfer.
Traditional CFD simulations are costly and hard to scale. BubbleML, a high-resolution dataset from Flash-X simulations, enables ML models to
efficiently learn and predict bubble dynamics. By leveraging data-driven approaches, we aim to bridge the gap between physical simulations and
forecasting, making bubble behavior prediction more accessible and cost-effective.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

This repository contains three different model implementations for predicting the velocity fields of boiling bubbles over time:

- **UNet**: A convolutional encoder-decoder model optimized for spatial pattern recognition. Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Dr5Lm_bKwjoUFLLV3LnQ2IEeUKOyZeRn?usp=sharing
- **FNO (Fourier Neural Operator)**: A spectral model designed for learning spatiotemporal patterns, particularly suited for PDE-like problems. Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1ura3AK4RTJWFTvuAkxsUuAk5v5-BwN8D?usp=sharing
- **ConvLSTM**: A model combining convolutional layers and LSTM to capture both spatial and temporal dependencies. Google Colab Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NkVe6KD5u5eEqSqFTVdV_9zmaTC9ot7b?usp=sharing
- **Poster**: The DeepBoil_ClimateChangePoster_Final.pdf file is a summary of our work and findings.

  PS: Note that for each of the notebooks, the dataset must be uploaded to your runtime. 

## üìå Highlights from the Poster

You can view our project summary and results in the [poster](./DeepBoil_ClimateChangePoster_Final.pdf). It includes:
- Model architectures
- One-step and rollout (multi-step) predictions
- Training and validation losses
- Visualizations of predicted velocity fields

## üîö Conclusion
Overall, the loss values across all models are approximately similar, indicating comparable performance in terms of error metrics. However, ConvLSTM demonstrates the best performance for single time-step predictions. This is evident from the visualizations, where the predicted velocity fields closely match the ground truth. This strong performance is expected, as the ConvLSTM architecture effectively captures both temporal dependencies (through LSTM layers) and spatial patterns (through convolutional layers), making it particularly well-suited for sequence-based spatial data.

In contrast, for multi-step (roll-out) predictions, the U-Net model performs best. This could be attributed to the fact that recurrent models like LSTMs are prone to error accumulation over multiple time steps, as small inaccuracies compound during each prediction step. U-Net, being a fully convolutional architecture, may handle long-term structure and spatial consistency more robustly in this context.

For more reliable model comparisons in the future, it would be beneficial to train and evaluate all models on the exact same training and validation sets. While a 70:30 split was maintained for each model in this study, the data subsets differed, which could have influenced performance differences across models.
